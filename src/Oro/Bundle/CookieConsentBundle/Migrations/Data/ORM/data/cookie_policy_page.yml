            that are downloaded to your computer, to improve your experience. This page describes what information
            they gather, how we use it and why we sometimes need to store these cookies. We will also share how you
            can prevent these cookies from being stored however this may downgrade or 'break' certain elements of the
            sites functionality.

        <p><strong>How We Use Cookies</strong></p>
        <p>
            We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below. Unfortunately in most cases there are no industry
            standard options for disabling cookies without completely disabling the functionality and features they
            add to this site. It is recommended that you leave on all cookies if you are not sure whether you need
            them or not in case they are used to provide a service that you use.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Disabling Cookies</strong></p>
        <p>
            You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser (see your browser Help
            for how to do this). Be aware that disabling cookies will affect the functionality of this and many other
            websites that you visit. Disabling cookies will usually result in also disabling certain functionality

        <p><strong>More Information</strong></p>
        <p>
            Hopefully that has clarified things for you and as was previously mentioned if there is something that
            you aren't sure whether you need or not it's usually safer to leave cookies enabled in case it does
